	abstract = {In seminal works of genome rearrangements, the distance between two genomes is measured by the minimum number of rearrangements (e.g., reversals, transpositions, {DCJs}, or combination of them) needed to transform a given permutation into another, where permutations represent gene orders of genomes with the same gene content. For the past few years, researchers have been extending the traditional models of genome rearrangement distance by either considering unbalanced genomes or adding more features to the representation of the genomes to be compared. In this work, we make progress in this direction by studying the intergenic transposition distance on unbalanced genomes, which also considers insertions and deletions as non-conservative rearrangements in the set of possible rearrangements to compute the distance. The best previously known result for this problem is a 4.5-approximation using breakpoints. In this paper, we use an adaptation of the breakpoint graph, a structure used in the literature on genome rearrangements, to present a new lower bound for the distance and a 4-approximation algorithm.},

The length of this sequence is called distance, and determining it is the main goal in genome rearrangement distance problems. Problems in the genome rearrangement field differ regarding the set of rearrangement events allowed and the genome representation. In this work, we consider the scenario where the genomes share the same set of genes, gene orientation is known, and intergenic regions (structures between a pair of genes and at the extremities of the genome) are taken into account. We use two models, the first model allows only conservative events (reversals and moves), and the second model includes non-conservative events (insertions and deletions) in the intergenic regions. We show that both models result in {NP}-hard problems and we present algorithms with an approximation factor of 2.},

	abstract = {Recent works on genome rearrangements have shown that incorporating intergenic region information along with gene order in models provides better estimations for the rearrangement distance than using gene order alone. The reversal distance is one of the main problems in genome rearrangements. It has a polynomial time algorithm when only gene order is used to model genomes, assuming that repeated genes do not exist and that gene orientation is known, even when the genomes have distinct gene sets. The reversal distance is {NP}-hard and has a 2-approximation algorithm when incorporating intergenic regions. However, the problem has only been studied assuming genomes with the same set of genes. In this work, we consider the variation that incorporates intergenic regions and that allows genomes to have distinct sets of genes, a scenario that leads us to include indels operations (insertions and deletions). We present a 2.5-approximation algorithm using the labeled intergenic breakpoint graph, which is based on the well-known breakpoint graph structure. We also present an experimental analysis of the proposed algorithm using simulated data, which showed that the practical approximation factor is considerably less than 2.5.

	abstract = {Most mathematical models for genome rearrangement problems have considered only gene order. In this way, the rearrangement distance considering some set of events, such as reversal and transposition events, is commonly defined as the minimum number of rearrangement events that transform the gene order from a genome {\textbackslash}mathcal G\_1G1 into the gene order from a genome {\textbackslash}mathcal G\_2G2. Recent works initiate incorporating more information such as the sizes of the intergenic regions (i.e., number of nucleotides between pairs of consecutive genes), which yields good results for estimated distances on real data. In these models, besides transforming the gene order, the sequence of rearrangement events must transform the list of intergenic regions sizes from {\textbackslash}mathcal G\_1G1 into the list of intergenic regions sizes from {\textbackslash}mathcal G\_2G2 (target list). We study a new variation where the target list is flexible, in the sense that each target intergenic region size is in a range of acceptable values. This allows us to model scenarios where the main objective is still to transform the order of genes from the source genome into the target genome, allowing flexibility in the sizes of the intergenic regions, since the nucleotides in these regions tend to undergo more changes when compared to genes. We investigate the rearrangement distance considering three sets of events, two with the exclusive use of reversals or transpositions, and the other allowing both rearrangement events. We present approximation algorithms for the problems and an {NP}-hardness proof. Our results rely on the Flexible Weighted Cycle Graph, adapted from the breakpoint graph to deal with flexible intergenic regions sizes.},

If no gene is repeated, genomes are thus modeled as signed permutations of the form \$\${\textbackslash}pi =({\textbackslash}pi \_1 {\textbackslash}pi \_2 {\textbackslash}ldots {\textbackslash}pi \_n)\$\$, and in that case we can consider without loss of generality that one of them is the identity permutation \$\${\textbackslash}iota \_n =(1 2 {\textbackslash}ldots n)\$\$, and that we just need to sort the other (i.e., transform it into \$\${\textbackslash}iota \_n\$\$). The most studied genome rearrangement events are reversals, where a segment of the genome is reversed and reincorporated at the same location; and transpositions, where two consecutive segments are exchanged. Many variants, e.g., combining different types of (possibly constrained) rearrangements, have been proposed in the literature. One of them considers that the number of genes involved, in a reversal or a transposition, is never greater than two, which is known as the problem of sorting by super short operations (or {SSOs}).},

	abstract = {The evolutionary distance between two genomes can be estimated by computing the minimum length sequence of operations, called genome rearrangements, that transform one genome into another. Usually, a genome is modeled as an ordered sequence of (possibly signed) genes, and almost all the studies that have been undertaken in the genome rearrangement literature consist in shaping biological scenarios into mathematical models: for instance, allowing different genome rearrangements operations at the same time, adding constraints to these rearrangements (e.g., each rearrangement can affect at most a given number k of genes), considering that a rearrangement implies a cost depending on its length rather than a unit cost, etc. However, most of the works in the field have overlooked some important features inside genomes, such as the presence of sequences of nucleotides between genes, called intergenic regions. In this work, we investigate the problem of computing the distance between two genomes, taking into account both gene order and intergenic sizes; the genome rearrangement operation we consider here is a constrained type of reversals, called super short reversals, which affect up to two (consecutive) genes. We propose here three algorithms to solve the problem: a 3-approximation algorithm that applies to any instance, and two additional algorithms that apply only on specific types of genomes with respect to their gene order: the first one is an exact algorithm, while the second is a 2-approximation algorithm.},

	abstract = {Estimating the evolutionary distance between genomes of two organisms is a challenging task for Computational Biology. One of the most well-accepted ways to do this is to consider the size of the smallest sequence of rearrangement events required to transform one genome into another, characterizing the rearrangement distance problem. Computationally, genomes can be represented as permutations of integers and, with this, the problem can be reduced to transforming a permutation into the identity with the minimum number of operations (sorting the permutation). These operations are given by a rearrangement model and they affect segments of a genome in different ways. Among the most common models are those that allow only reversals, only transpositions, or both of them. In this paper we study sorting permutations when a restriction of biological relevance is added: the size of the rearrangements should be at most a given value \$\${\textbackslash}lambda \$\$. Some results are known for \$\${\textbackslash}lambda = 2\$\$and \$\${\textbackslash}lambda = 3\$\$but, to the best of our knowledge, there are no results for \$\${\textbackslash}lambda {\textgreater} 3\$\$. We consider rearrangement models that allow reversals and/or transpositions for sorting unsigned permutations given any value of \$\${\textbackslash}lambda \$\$.

When we use permutations to represent the genomes, this reduces to the problem of sorting a permutation using some sequence of rearrangements. The traditional approach is to find a sequence of minimum length. However, some studies show that some rearrangements are more likely to disturb an individual, and so a weighted approach is closer to the real evolutionary process. Most weighted approaches consider that the cost of a rearrangement can be related to its type or to the number of elements affected by it. This work introduces a new type of cost function, which is related to the amount of fragmentation caused by a rearrangement. We present some results about lower and upper bounds for the fragmentation-weighted problems and the relation between the unweighted and the fragmentation-weighted approach.

Despite the fact that we addressed a specific problem, both heuristics can be applied to many others within the area of genome rearrangement. When time is a crucial factor, Sliding Window is a better choice because it runs in linear time and improves the initial solutions in 76.4\% of cases. If the quality of the solution is a priority, Look Ahead should be preferred because it improves the initial solutions in 97.6\% of cases, but it runs in \$\${\textbackslash}mathcal \{O\}(n{\textasciicircum}3 {\textbackslash}times alg(n))\$\$, where alg(n) is the complexity of the algorithm given as input. By using these heuristics one may find a good tradeoff between running time and solution improvement.},

	abstract = {Genome Rearrangement ({GR}) is a field of computational biology that uses conserved regions within two genomes as a source of information for comparison purposes. This branch of genomics uses the order in which these regions appear to infer evolutive scenarios and to compute distances between species, while usually neglecting non-conserved {DNA} sequence. This paper sheds light on this matter and proposes models that use both conserved and non-conserved sequences as a source of information. The questions that arise are how classic {GR} algorithms should be adapted and how much would we pay in terms of complexity to have this feature. Advances on these questions aid in measuring advantages of including such approach in {GR} algorithms. We propose to represent non-conserved regions by their lengths and apply this idea in a genome rearrangement problem called “Sorting by Block-Interchanges”. The problem is an interesting choice on the theory of computation viewpoint because it is one of the few problems that are solvable in polynomial time and whose algorithm has a small number of steps. That said, we present a 2-approximation algorithm to this problem along with data structures and formal definitions that may be generalized to other problems in {GR} field considering intergenic regions.},

	abstract = {Understanding how different two organisms are is one question addressed by the comparative genomics field. A well-accepted way to estimate the evolutionary distance between genomes of two organisms is finding the rearrangement distance, which is the smallest number of rearrangements needed to transform one genome into another. By representing genomes as permutations, one of them can be represented as the identity permutation, and, so, we reduce the problem of transforming one permutation into another to the problem of sorting a permutation using the minimum number of rearrangements. This work investigates the problems of sorting permutations using reversals and/or transpositions, with some additional restrictions of biological relevance. Given a value λ, the problem now is how to sort a λ-permutation, which is a permutation whose elements are less than λ positions away from their correct places (regarding the identity), by applying the minimum number of rearrangements. Each λ-rearrangement must have size, at most, λ, and, when applied to a λ-permutation, the result should also be a λ-permutation. We present algorithms with approximation factors of O(λ2), O(λ), and O(1) for the problems of Sorting λ-Permutations by λ-Reversals, by λ-Transpositions, and by both operations.},

	abstract = {Comparative genomics is a field of biology that aims at comparing genomes of different species. One major question of this field is to find the evolutionary distance between two given genomes. One way to estimate such distance is to use the rearrangement distance, which consists in finding a minimum cost sequence of rearrangements that transforms one genome into another. We use permutations to model the genomes being compared and, in this way, we can treat this problem as the problem of sorting a permutation with a minimum cost sequence of rearrangements. In the early works with rearrangement distance, it was considered that all rearrangements are equally likely to occur and, consequently, they use a unitary cost for all rearrangements. Some variations of the problem were motivated by the observation that rearrangements involving large segments of a genome rarely occur. One of these variants also uses a unitary cost, however it adds a constraint in the length of the operations allowed to estimate the distance. Another variant uses a cost function based on the rearrangement’s length. In this work, we study problems that combine both variants, that is, problems with a constraint in the rearrangement’s length and with a cost function based on the rearrangement’s length. We present approximation algorithms for five such problems involving reversals and/or transpositions for sorting signed and unsigned permutations. We also analyze the problems for specific parameters of the length restriction and for when the cost function is equal to \$\${\textbackslash}ell {\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}alpha \$\$, where \$\${\textbackslash}ell \$\$is the rearrangement’s length and \$\${\textbackslash}alpha {\textbackslash}ge 1\$\$is a real value parameter.},

In the literature, several models were designed to estimate the number of events that occurred during the evolution, but these models represent genomes as a sequence of genes, overlooking the genetic material between consecutive genes. However, recent studies show that taking into account the genetic material present between consecutive genes can be more realistic. Reversal and transposition are genome rearrangements widely studied in the literature. A reversal inverts a segment of the genome while a transposition swaps the positions of two consecutive segments. Genomes also undergo non-conservative events (events that alter the amount of genetic material) such as insertion and deletion, which insert and remove genetic material from intergenic regions of the genome, respectively. We study problems considering both gene order and intergenic regions size. We investigate the reversal distance between two genomes in two scenarios: with and without non-conservative events. For both problems, we show that they belong to {NP}-hard problems class and we present a 4-approximation algorithm. We also study the reversal and transposition distance between two genomes (and the variation with non-conservative events) and we present a 6-approximation algorithm.},

When considering that genomes undergo different types of rearrangements, it can be assumed that some events are more common than others. To model this assumption one can assign different weights to different events, where more common events tend to cost less than others. However, this approach, called weighted, does not guarantee that the rearrangement assumed to be the most frequent will be also the most frequently returned by proposed algorithms. To overcome this issue, we investigate a new problem where we seek the shortest sequence of rearrangement events able to transform one genome into the other, with a restriction regarding the proportion between the events returned. Here we consider two rearrangement events: reversal, that inverts the order and the orientation of the genes inside a segment of the genome, and transposition, that moves a segment of the genome to another position. We present an approximation algorithm applicable to any desired proportion, for both scenarios where the orientation of the genes is known or unknown. We also show an improved (asymptotic) approximation algorithm for the case where the gene orientation is known.},

More realistic models started to consider gene repetition or the presence of intergenic regions, sequences of nucleotides between genes and in the extremities of the genome. This work explores the transposition and reversal events applied in a genome representation considering both gene repetition and intergenic regions. We define two problems called Minimum Common Intergenic String Partition and Reverse Minimum Common Intergenic String Partition. Using a relation with these two problems, we show a \$\${\textbackslash}Theta {\textbackslash}left( k {\textbackslash}right)\$\$-approximation for the Intergenic Transposition Distance, the Intergenic Reversal Distance, and the Intergenic Reversal and Transposition Distance problems, where k is the maximum number of copies of a gene in the genomes.

It has a polynomial time algorithm when only gene order is used to model genomes, assuming that repeated genes do not exist and that gene orientation is known, even when the genomes have distinct gene sets. The reversal distance is {NP}-hard and has a 2-approximation algorithm when incorporating intergenic regions. However, the problem has only been studied assuming genomes with the same set of genes. In this work, we consider the variation that incorporates intergenic regions and that allows genomes to have distinct sets of genes, a scenario that leads us to include indels operations (insertions and deletions). We present a 3-approximation algorithm using the labeled intergenic breakpoint graph, which is based on the well-known breakpoint graph structure.},

	abstract = {In comparative genomics, one goal is to find similarities between genomes of different organisms. Comparisons using genome features like genes, gene order, and regulatory sequences are carried out with this purpose in mind. Genome rearrangements are mutational events that affect large extensions of the genome. They are responsible for creating extant species with conserved genes in different positions across genomes. Close species — from an evolutionary point of view — tend to have the same set of genes or share most of them. When we consider gene order to compare two genomes, it is possible to use a parsimony criterion to estimate how close the species are. We are interested in the shortest sequence of genome rearrangements capable of transforming one genome into the other, which is named rearrangement distance. Reversal is one of the most studied genome rearrangements events. This event acts in a segment of the genome, inverting the position and the orientation of genes in it. Transposition is another widely studied event. This event swaps the position of two consecutive segments of the genome. When the genome has no gene repetition, a common approach is to map it as a permutation such that each element represents a conserved block. When genomes have replicated genes, this mapping is usually performed using strings. The number of replicas depends on the organisms being compared, but in many scenarios, it tends to be small. In this work, we study the rearrangement distance between genomes with replicated genes considering that the orientation of genes is unknown. We present four heuristics for the problem of genome rearrangement distance with replicated genes. We carry out experiments considering the exclusive use of the reversals or transpositions events, as well as the version in which both events are allowed. We developed a database of simulated genomes and compared our results with other algorithms from the literature. The experiments showed that our heuristics with more sophisticated rules presented a better performance than the known algorithms to estimate the evolutionary distance between genomes with replicated genes. In order to validate the application of our algorithms in real data, we construct a phylogenetic tree based on the distance provided by our algorithm and compare it with a know tree from the literature.},
